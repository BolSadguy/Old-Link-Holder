Based on OSBMX https://github.com/TheTrainGoes/GP2040-Projects/tree/main/Open%20Source%20Buttons/OSBMX

Does not include mounting nuts, get that from the OSBMX repository above

Mounts in a 24mm hole. Requires a spare stub for Phreakmods Link. Designed for the JLF version of the Link and these 24mm rubber hole plugs from aliexpress https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001797243602.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.22.656f1802g4zsxH

Test prints were done in black resin from JLCPCB

UPDATE (2023/11/13) - An alternate STL has been made for the LS-32 version of the Link base. It was made with measurements given to me by Phreakmods but has not been tested.

Please remember to give credit where its due.
